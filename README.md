# LogframeLab-server

Logframe Lab is a project of Arqaam which anticipates to fill two gaps. On the one hand, it shall support the creation of more standardised logframes from implementing partners, which will in turn lead to more standardised data and thus more comparability of projects. On the other hand, it can help development actors to learn more about logframes and indicators, and how to choose good indicators for their respective projects.
